# bloodRockTracking

This repository includes 2 different app.py files that I was trying to debug. The app is hosted at https://rjames.pythonanywhere.com from 12/5/2017 - 12/10/2017. With this app I can send a text message to the app and the website will upate with a timestamp at that location so my family and friends can track my progress during the race. 

I tried to get ajax to work with this so people would not have to hit refresh, but I could never get it to work properly once it is running on the pythonanywhere server (only worked locally). Any help is appreciated.
